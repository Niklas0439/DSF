# Machine Learning Project: Kinase Activity Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the activity of kinase enzymes based on publicly available data. Kinases play a crucial role in various cellular processes, and their dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, making them an important target for drug discovery efforts.

## Project Goals

1. **Learn about Machine Learning**: Gain theoretical knowledge and practical experience in machine learning concepts, algorithms, and techniques.

2. **Learn about Basic Linux Usage**: Develop proficiency in using Linux operating systems, which are widely used in scientific computing and data analysis.

3. **Explore Resources at UniBe**: Familiarize yourself with the resources available at the University of Bern (UniBe) for conducting computational research projects.

4. **Build a Kinase Activity Prediction Model**: Utilize publicly available data to train and validate a machine learning model capable of predicting the activity of kinase enzymes based on their structural and chemical properties.

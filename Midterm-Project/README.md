# Machine Learning Project: Kinase Activity Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the activity of kinase enzymes based on publicly available data. Kinases play a crucial role in various cellular processes, and their dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, making them an important target for drug discovery efforts.

## Project Goals

1. **Learn about Machine Learning**: Gain theoretical knowledge and practical experience in machine learning concepts, algorithms, and techniques.

2. **Learn about Basic Linux Usage**: Develop proficiency in using Linux operating systems, which are widely used in scientific computing and data analysis.

3. **Explore Resources at UniBe**: Familiarize yourself with the resources available at the University of Bern (UniBe) for conducting computational research projects.

4. **Build a Kinase Activity Prediction Model**: Utilize publicly available data to train and validate a machine learning model capable of predicting the activity of kinase enzymes based on their structural and chemical properties.

## Getting Started

### 1. Read and run the Tutorial

The tutorial to be followed is [TeachOpenCADD](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials/T022_ligand_based_screening_neural_network.html).

The used training set differs from the one used in the tutorial and is provided by the [DSF Course](https://cloud-new.gdb.tools/index.php/s/ZfZM7itQf3rm6Sw).

The Tutorial was run and documented in a [Jupyter Notebook](Tutorial.ipynb)

####**Questions regarding the Tutorial:**
- **What is in the training set, how big is it?**  The training set consists of approximately 125,000 data points from the kinase dataset, which represents 70% of the total data.
### 3. Access Ubelix HPC Cluster
Gain access to the Ubelix HPC cluster by following the [documentation](https://hpc-unibe-ch.github.io/).


### 4. Run Training on Ubelix
Modify the code from the tutorial to run the relevant part (training) on the Ubelix HPC cluster. 

### 5. Submit Training Job on Ubelix
Run the training step on Ubelix. Provide the submission script and the code you run there.
